# **PlumCherry**
PlumCherry is a colorful and unique Discord theme, somewhat inspired by Y2K design. I made it for myself, but a lot of people wanted it, so here ya go!

It's currently in a **Work in Progress** state, so a lot of things are currently not done or inconsistent with other elements.

## Installation
- Download the .css file and put it in your respective themes folder.
- Go in `Settings` -> `Themes` and enable PlumCherry.
