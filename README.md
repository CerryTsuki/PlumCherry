# **PlumCherry**
A colorful and unique Discord theme, somewhat inspired by Y2K design. Currently a work-in-progress, I'm using Vencord.
Features customizable colors and a messy CSS thing.

## Installation
- Download the .css file and put it in your respective themes folder.
- Go in `Settings` -> `Themes` and enable it.
