# **PlumCherry**
PlumCherry is a colorful and unique Discord theme, somewhat inspired by Y2K design. I made it for myself, but a lot of people wanted their hands on it, so there ya go i guess lol

It's currently in a **Work in Progress** state, so a lot of things are currently not done or inconsistent with other elements.

Currently only tested with Vencord, I don't know if this is compatible with BetterDiscord.

## Installation
- [Download the theme](https://github.com/CerryTsuki/PlumCherry/releases) and put `PlumCherry.css` file in your respective themes folder.
- In Discord, go in `User Settings` -> `Themes` and enable PlumCherry.

Feel free to fork this with your custom theme! I'll include those I like in the previews.
