<sub>quick forenote, discord changed their theme recently and seems to be breaking stuff as i fix it and unfortunately kneecapped my motivation to work on this. i'll try my best to fix it on my own but i'm busy with other projects.</sub>

# **PlumCherry**
PlumCherry is a colorful and unique Discord theme inspired by Y2K design. I made it for myself, but a lot of people wanted their hands on it, so there ya go i guess lol

It's currently in a **Work in Progress** state, which means that some things may change drastically, and your custom theme may not be compatible anymore.

Fully compatible with [Vencord](https://vencord.dev/), also compatible with [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/).

## Installation
- [Download the theme](https://github.com/CerryTsuki/PlumCherry/releases) and put `PlumCherry.css` file in your respective themes folder.
- In Discord, go in `User Settings` -> `Themes` and enable PlumCherry.

Feel free to fork this with your custom theme! I'll include those I like in the previews.
