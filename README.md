<sub>quick forenote, discord changed their theme recently and seems to be breaking stuff as i fix it and unfortunately kneecapped my motivation to work on this. i'll try my best to fix it on my own but since i'm busy with other projects they'll be fairly slow.</sub>

# **PlumCherry**
PlumCherry is a colorful and unique Discord theme inspired by Y2K design. I made it for myself, but a lot of people wanted their hands on it, so there ya go i guess lol

Unfortunately it's currently in a state of indefinite hiatus. I will provide fixes for existing elements if updates break them, but new elements will be added sporadically.
Discord has been consistently updating their CSS and becoming a cluttered mess of menus, it's become difficult to find obscure menus and play CSS Whack-A-Mole everytime they change CSS class names.

Fully compatible with [Vencord](https://vencord.dev/), also compatible with [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/).

## Installation
- [Download the theme](https://github.com/CerryTsuki/PlumCherry/releases) and put `PlumCherry.css` file in your respective themes folder.
- In Discord, go in `User Settings` -> `Themes` and enable PlumCherry.

Feel free to fork this with your custom theme! I'll include those I like in the previews.
